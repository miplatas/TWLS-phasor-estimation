# Phasor-estimation-through-Taylor-Weighted-Least-Squares-(TWLS)

# This m file shows one example of dynamic phasor estimation for a fundamental tone with time-varying amplitude, phase, and frequency.
# The algorithm uses a polynomial approximation to represent the phasor during the observation window. The Weighted Least Squares criterion is used to obtain the best coefficients of the polynomial.

# The complete description of the algorithm can be found in:
